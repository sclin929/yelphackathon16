# Restaurant Along

Restaurant Along is my submission for Yelp Hackathon 16.

The purpose of this web app is to allow users to easily find restaurants located along their driving route. Users can also filter the restaurants by categories, such as cuisine, to help them identify the best, and most convenient, restaurant for them!
